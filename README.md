## Laravel One-Time Login (Single Session Login)

The functionality described is commonly referred to as "one-time login" or "single session login." This ensures that a user can only have one active session at a time. If the user logs in from a new device or browser, any existing sessions are invalidated, effectively logging the user out from other devices or browsers. This is useful for enhancing security and ensuring that user accounts are not accessed simultaneously from multiple locations.

## Main Features of One-Time Login (Single Session Login)

Single Active Session: Ensures that a user can only have one active session at a time. If the user logs in from a new device or browser, any existing sessions are invalidated.

Session Management: Tracks the session ID or token associated with the user and compares it with the current session to determine if the user should be logged out.

Security Notifications: Optionally, notify users when they are logged out due to a new login from another device.

Session Expiry Handling: Ensures that sessions are properly expired and cleaned up to prevent stale sessions from lingering.

Middleware Integration: Uses middleware to enforce the single session policy across all routes or specific routes.


## Advantages of One-Time Login (Single Session Login)

Enhanced Security: Prevents unauthorized access by ensuring that only one session is active at a time. This reduces the risk of session hijacking and unauthorized access from multiple devices.

Account Protection: Protects user accounts from being accessed simultaneously from different locations, which can be a sign of compromised credentials.

User Awareness: Keeps users aware of their active sessions. If they are logged out unexpectedly, they can be alerted to potential unauthorized access.

Resource Management: Reduces server load and resource usage by limiting the number of active sessions per user.

Compliance: Helps in meeting security compliance requirements for applications that need to enforce strict session management policies.

User Control: Gives users more control over their sessions, allowing them to manage and terminate sessions from different devices if needed.
